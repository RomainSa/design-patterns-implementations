# Design patterns implementations

Implementation of some design patterns from the book "Head first design patterns". Including:

## Strategy
**Definition:**  
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.

**Principles:**
- Encapsulate what varies to separate it from what stays the same
- Favour composition over inheritance (Has-a vs Is-a)
- Program to an interface
